  "shared secret key can communicate securely when a powerful adversary eavesdrops and tampers with traffic. " +
  "We will examine many deployed protocols and analyze mistakes in existing systems. The second half of the " +
  "course discusses public-key techniques that let two parties generate a shared secret key. Throughout the " +
  "course participants will be exposed to many exciting open problems in the field and work on fun (optional) " +
  "programming projects. In a second course (Crypto II) we will cover more advanced cryptographic tasks such as " +
  "zero-knowledge, privacy mechanisms, and other forms of encryption.",
